/* ==========================================================================
   curriculum.js — the Reveal Math Grade 2 pacing guide and the Benchmark
   Advance Grade 2 scope and sequence, as data, and the places the suite
   uses them. One file because the planner takes one added tag.

   Source: the district's "Editable Pacing Guide — Grade 2" (Reveal Math,
   12 units, 153 days). Every lesson carries the standard, the learning
   targets and the materials exactly as the guide prints them, apart from
   the handful of typos listed in HANDOFF.md under v60. Each unit's days add
   up to the guide's own "Time for Unit"; tests/test-reveal-pacing.js
   checks that, so a mistyped day count cannot slip in.

   STANDARDS. The guide uses CCSS codes. The gradebook records the 2021
   Oregon Mathematics Standards, which kept the CCSS codes for OA and NBT
   and renumbered measurement, data and geometry into 2.GM and 2.DR. CROSS
   below is that crosswalk. Marks are still stored under the Oregon code, so
   nothing already entered moves and the report card lines are untouched;
   the gradebook only changes which code it shows. Unit 1 ("Math Is ...")
   teaches to grade 1 standards as a launch, so it maps to nothing in the
   grade 2 gradebook.

   IN THE PLANNER this file takes over Math's stepper. The planner rolls a
   "ul" subject over at a fixed number of lessons per unit; Reveal's units
   run from 5 to 11 lessons, with an opener, a probe, a review and a test
   between them. + and − now walk the guide's own sequence. A lesson is
   still stored as {unit, lesson}, exactly as before, so every day already
   recorded reads the same; a day that is not a lesson adds k (the kind),
   e.g. {unit:2, lesson:4, k:"probe"}. The planner file itself is not
   edited: this is one added <script> tag, and removing it puts the old
   stepper back. Turning the guide off for Math (in Math's position sheet)
   does the same without removing anything.

   Nothing personal is in this file.
